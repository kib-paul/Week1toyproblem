## Description
# Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
This is a console application for calculating the Student grade for a specific student. I've used the IF...ELSE IF statement to solve this problem. 
It requires the user to input the marks of the student and the Student's Marks and Student's Grade will be outputted according to the met condition of the Student's Marks
# Challenge 2: Speed Detector
This is a console application for checking the speed limit of a given car at a particular instance and awards a 1-point penalty for every 5 km exceeded. If the speed detected gives a car more than 20 points at a given instance then the driver's license is declared to be suspened.
# Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
This is a console application to calculate the Gross Salary,PAYE, NHIF, NSSF and Net Salary when given the Employee Basic Salary and Benefits.
